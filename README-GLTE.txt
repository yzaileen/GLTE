Hey, hello, welcome to GLTE! Part python troubleshooting minigame and part uhhhhh story? and 
also my project for the Turing Report C/V. In this project I'll be exploring the Turing Test and 
the Turing Machine. I'll be using this document to document my sources and elaborate on some 
information that I couldn't fit into GLTE. Also this contains the instructions for GLTE, so please
read that.

If the dialogue reads as forced and pretentious, that is because it is. I. I haven't had an organic conversation
with another person in months. I don't know how to cover all the bases and also have like, good dialogue.

And since I have created what is essentially a space to ramble by making this document, the general concept
of this story was inspired by the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea but ALSO Swan Song by the Mechanisms. That's a song. 
And a really good one. Falling in love with an inorganic being can be something that is so personal-

Also sorry I got slightly lost in the sauce with weird intangible metaphors or whatever.

Additional Notes (again) (but months later, since I'm typing this as of 5/20)(Started this in like. January? February? It has been a Time.)

AHHHHHHH FINALLY GOT MYSELF TO TYPE UP THE ENDING
it's uh. this game is a bit incoherent. my writing style's changed. but this is roughly 300 lines of code that I'm not redoing.
 
I'm pretty sure this covers all the bases of the Turing project, but does it cover all the bases of my personal standards
for stories? mmm. :( Ack. This is fine.

GLTE Instructions:

First order of business, GLTE is meant to be run on a Python editor like Spyder. You start the
game by running the code. Press enter to advance the game. Parts of the game will require you
to go into the actual code and change parts of it. I suggest you make a copy of the original code
before you start the game. 

Changing parts of the code will sometimes be just commenting/uncommenting certain lines or 
running a function. Sometimes when you run some code it will give you an error message. THIS IS
INTENTIONAL. I PROMISE. PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE THE GAME. IT WORKS. PLEASE. Just go to the line that
the error message says is wrong and fix the code. This is part of the game. (lol mostly it's just random
little troubleshooting exercises that i threw in there so it wasn't just. several walls of text. 
exercise your brain or whatever.)

There's also a cheat sheet included.

There will be comments in the code. Some of them are plot relevant, some of them are there to
guide the player. Plot relevant (PSYCHE this project barely has a plot) comments start
with ## and guiding comments start with #.

Sometimes the console will stop with no clear line or function to go to. That's when you look at the code
Sometimes a text segment will end with a function in brackets. That'll tell you where to go in the code.
But not always will there be a function in brackets.

You'll run different functions as you go. If you don't want to have to click through all the previous functions,
comment out the ones you're done with.

DM on Mattermost for any additional questions! Sorry if things are unclear!
-----------
Also if you don't want to go through this headache of a thing that's fine I also don't want to go 
through this headache of a thing. For grading purposes, the bulk of the information is under the function 
def computersci(). And a brief discussion of the Turing Test in def query2(). There's still somewhat 
relevant stuff in the rest of the game, but for grading purposes. That.

Rambling:

god I WISH I could've found a way to fit the concept of technological singularity into this. Like there's a lot of
ways to go about singularity but one of them concerns AI advancing exponentially, like an explosion of intelligence 
that changes the world and humanity forever. I think in science fiction this sort of manifests as a robot takeover.
You know? Like um um um

I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is about an AI that kills all but 5 humans, and spends its time torturing the
humans because it doesn't like people. Like this is an example where the AI gains sentience, thoughts, emotions. (even
if it's just sadistic pleasure at other people's suffering.)

On the other hand, Roko's Basilisk (which I think is stupid) has an AI that doesn't necessarily have its own desires and
feelings, it just tortures people as a way to ensure its existence. (Which I think is stupid) 

Anyways superintelligence in fiction is fun. (Hey what do you think about GLaDOS?)

So anyways the Turing Test was to see if a robot could pass as a human, but is there a threshold that makes an AI an actual
living thing with feelings and stuff that we have to consider? Is there a way to artificially create life using the computational
system of what is basically an advanced Turing machine? What makes a person a person? 

If artificial intelligence hits singularity, does that make it intelligent? What will it look like, will it be able to "think"? 

I remember watching a video (or reading an article? I don't remember.) that talked about how maybe we should relax our definition of 
intelligent life. It was in regards to scientists looking for intelligent life on other planets, and like, maybe the things that we're
looking for when we think about intelligent life isn't the system that's developed on other planets. We could completely skip over 
intelligent life because it's not what we're looking for. (It was also about colonialism + space)

So like if singularity happens, is it gonna kind of be like that? Could robots run on a different system of being alive? I don't know.

Hey do you think its possible for machines to feel pain?
