CHEAT SHEET

Start the game by uncommenting the command that calls startglte()

When you run personal1, it calls a nonexistent function. replace the 3 in 
    ch1 = interests[3]
with 0, 1, or 2. You get something different for each number, but 1's the number for plot advancement.

subject can't be converted into an integer. replace subject in
    count = count + int(subject)
with literally any number greater than 0. it doesn't matter. just greater than 0, or the second half
of the function won't run.

change
    emptylist.join("*")
to "*".join(emptylist)

uncomment somethingswrong()

write
    ending()
